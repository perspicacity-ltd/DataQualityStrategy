## A little bit about Perspicacity Ltd
Perspicacity provides decision support consultancy, coaching, & development to the NHS. They are passionate about reducing the cost of software development to the NHS and aspire to create an active community of NHS and commercial organisations. They all share a common goal of improving the quality and efficiency of patient care through better, and more informed, decision making.

Open source helps the healthcare community to do this by sharing software development, learning from each other, and help software meet the needs of every organisation without being constrained to a single solution or paying for the same piece of work over and again across different organisations.

Although these Data Quality open source products are suitable for any organisation, healthcare or not, they are here as a result of wanting to freely share Perspicacity's collective products and ideas across the NHS and to widen the benefit of good, but usually locally isolated, projects further.

Perspicacity's open source offerings can be found at https://github.com/perspicacity-ltd
